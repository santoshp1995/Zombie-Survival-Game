# Zombie-Survival-Game

Created this game as part of the final project for GAM 476 AI For Computer Games at DePaul University during the 2020 Winter Quarter. The purpose of the project was to program the AI to survive as many waves as possible before they are killed by zombies. 

This repository only contains the source code for the AI behavior trees and pathfinding as those were the core features I was required to implement for the project.
